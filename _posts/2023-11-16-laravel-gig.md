[Click here](https://github.com/BHammock33/laravelgigs) to check out the repository for an app I built using PHP and the Laravel Framework. This is a dummy app for posting Laravel jobs on the web. It has full user authentication, conditional access to pages/functionality depending on if the user is logged in or not. It also uses relationships between users and jobs so that only the job poster can edit/delete the job. I really liked the ease of working with the Laravel framework and PHP, compared to Java you can knock out boiler plate tasks much quikcer. I really liked the way routing and conditional access are handled through laravel. I have included images of the homepage, user managing their posted jobs, and user registration pages.
