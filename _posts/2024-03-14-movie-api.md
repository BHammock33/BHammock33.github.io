Working on a fullstack app with a springboot, java, and a mongodb back end with a fully mobile responsive React.js front end, communicating through a RESTapi powered by Springs rest controllers. This has been great because it allows be to more easily dig deep into nested object properties than thymeleaf. This has been a good exercise in passing more responsibility to the client side and minimizing unecessary server calls.
