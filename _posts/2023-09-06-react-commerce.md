[Click here](https://tangerine-dragon-b75ad8.netlify.app/) to check out an ecommerce site I made with React. Right now there are only a few items as it's just a proof of concept.
You can create an account and add items to your wishlist or cart. It uses a mocked Database from Mirage JS to hold items and users and Axios for HTTP requests.
The logic of adding in a real database would change some of the request paths but the logic for loading users/products would be similar, they would just be loaded
in from a DB before the current logic.
