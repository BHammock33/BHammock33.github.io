I recently went through Microsoft Azures "Create Cloud Native Applications" learning path and passed all of the assessments! Through it I developed my skills with Kubernetes, Docker, and Node.JS. I was also exposed to Azure's Internet of Things (IoT) hub and used it to monitor a simulated raspberry Pi and simulated weather gauges across the globe. I also worked with Azure PostgreSQL to make a full stack app with Node that could monitor a fictional companies inventory and telemetry data and store that info in the database. I also gained familiarity with managing resource groups and tags to provision resource deployment only when necessary and worked with GitHub actions to automate deployment of K8s clusters in a CI/CD pipeline. 
A lot of the learning material was out of date so I had to do a lot of self-study to get through the assignments and assessments but I feel that gave me an even deeper understanding of Azure and Cloud Native applications. I worked extensively with the Azure CLI to query the current versions of specific technologies supported in my region and used the CLI for the creation and management of Resource Groups. Overall I learned a lot and look forward to developing more Cloud Native applications in the future!
