Very proud to say that I have passed Microsoft's AZ-900 Azure fundamentals exam! The next step for me is to dig into Cosmos DB and prepare for DP-420. With the skills I learned in the Create Cloud Native Applications with Open Source Tools learning path I am confident that I will be able to pass this exam soon. Passing AZ-900 took a few days of dedicated study time but Azure makes cloud computing intuitive and user friendly. I'm looking forward to meeting other Azure/Microsoft fans at the upcoming Community Days in NYC!
