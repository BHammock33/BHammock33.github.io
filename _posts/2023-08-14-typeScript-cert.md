Very proud to say that I have passed W3 schools TypeScript exam! TypeScript makes a lot of sense to me with my background in Java. By taking this course and exam I was able to refamiliarize myself with TypeScript since I hadn't touched it in a long time. I plan on leveraging TS in the future to make my JS code more readable and catch errors before they impact the code base. With TypeScript I can apply the skills I have in Java to JavaScript which will increase my confidence in what I am developing as well as letting me build out applications more quickly.
