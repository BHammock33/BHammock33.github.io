Finished up my Ecommerce RestApi backend built with Node and TypeScript. This was a great project to work on because I had put TS to the side for a bit.
This project reminded me how much I enjoy the structure of TypeScript and it was good practice working asynchronously. The next steps for this project are to 
connect it to a MongoDB and then move on to the frontend. For now you can [Check out the repo here](https://github.com/BHammock33/typescriptECRest)
