Explore my Java-powered Dungeons and Dragons Party Manager by [clicking here](https://partymanager-production.up.railway.app/login). This application is developed using Java within the Spring framework, leveraging Hibernate ORM for seamless data persistence to a MySQL Database. Employing Spring Security user roles and Spring MVC, it facilitates conditional page rendering through Thymeleaf, contingent upon factors such as User Role, party activity, or Admin privileges. Feel free to explore the Demo mode, allowing you to experience the application without necessitating profile creation.
