title: A React Job Tracker
subtitle: Because there's too many Applications to keep track of
---

This is a job tracker I built with react and a mocked database with db.json. Here I can keep track of applications I have
sent out and if it led to an interview/ghosting/or someday a job! Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/BHammock33/project-manager), if you want to run it on
your box you'll need to use npm start to fire it up on local host:3000 and npm run server to spin the database up 
on localhost:5000
