Here is a quick JS project I worked up using the live server VS code extension. It reads a JSON file of card data and displays it on a dynamic HTML table. You can filter by the rarity of cards as well as swapping price between USD and EURO. When you filter by rarity it will throw an error but this is a quirk of the live server extension trying to read the data from the previous page while loading the new page, if you dismiss the error the data will dispaly as expected.
