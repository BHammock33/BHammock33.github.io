Lately I have been learning how to create web parts for Sharepoint Intranet sites using the SPFx. This framework makes it very simple to initialize a project with a framework already set up for what you are trying to do. I have used it to make a few different web parts but this one shows off multiple pages and accordion style layouts in one of the pages. The use of this is to enter different Apollo missions into the property pane to get details about that specific mission. 
Working with the SPFx has helped me a lot because it has given me more practice with TypeScript and React. I'm looking forward to making more web parts in the future. [Check out the repo here](https://github.com/BHammock33/Apollo-Tracker)
