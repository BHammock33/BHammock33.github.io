I'm continuing to work with HackerRank to get repetion in with some interview questions. These have been helpful by forcing me to code every day, even when I'm busy, and by exposing me to new ways of solving the problems through the discussions page. These questions along with my AlgoMonster study have given me a much stronger understanding of the different data types and the  best algorithms for handling sorting/traversing/retriving data from them.
