My name is Bennett Hammock: I went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I also graduated from the Coders Campus bootcamp, focusing on full stack Java Development. In my bootcamp I learned skills in Object Oriented Design, Java Programming, the Spring framework, MySQL databases, RESTful APIs, Hibernate ORM, Thymeleaf template engine, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. We also collaborated on projects to simulate real world work flow, getting experience in version control, Github issues, and the daily stand up style of work. Outside of work I enjoy fishing, watching the Carolina Hurricanes, and playing Dungeons and Dragons. As a D&D dungeon master, I have learned how to break down an objective that is months away into weekly milestones, creative problem solving, time management, and attention to detail. The biggest skill I've gained from D&D is adaptability, if you plan for A, B, and C, the players will always pick J. I also enjoy spening time with my lovely wife and our chunky pup.
